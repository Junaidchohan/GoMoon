# Go Moon

Lightweight Flutter UI practice app focused on building composable widgets and core UI layouts with Dart and Flutter. It was created as part of *The Complete Flutter Development Course* to strengthen hands-on experience with UI widgets and design patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🚀 Overview

**Go Moon** is a simple cross-platform Flutter app that demonstrates key UI structures and layouts using:

- Stateless and stateful widgets  
- Material design components  
- Layouts like `Row`, `Column`, `Stack`, `SafeArea`, `Container`  
- Images, buttons, dropdowns, alignment, and spacing  
- Reusable custom widgets to simplify UI construction:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This project is ideal for developers learning Flutter fundamentals and UI building patterns.

## 💡 Why This Matters

This project reinforces actionable Flutter skills that every mobile developer needs:

- Understand how Flutter composes UI using widgets  
- Learn consistent app structure  
- Build responsive screens that scale across devices

Developers can use this project as a starting point to extend with navigation, state management, and backend integration.
